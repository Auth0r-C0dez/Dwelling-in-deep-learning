# Dwelling in Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Dwelling in Deep Learning** repository by [Auth0r-C0dez](https://github.com/Auth0r-C0dez/Dwelling-in-deep-learning)! ðŸš€ This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects ranging from basic neural networks to advanced AI models.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Projects are categorized into three levels:

1. **Beginner** - Basic neural networks, image classification, and simple regression models.
2. **Intermediate** - CNNs, RNNs, and applications like NLP, object detection, and reinforcement learning.
3. **Advanced** - GANs, transformers, custom architectures, and full AI pipelines.

Each project is organized in its own directory with a `README.md` containing project details, setup instructions, and a demo link if available.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run any project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Auth0r-C0dez/Dwelling-in-deep-learning.git

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```
3. Follow the installation steps mentioned in the project's `README.md`.
